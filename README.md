## REAL TIME BUS TRACKER PROJECT

> Version 1 – a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement

It was time for a fun activity where I had to use some of the skills I’ve learned in manipulating styles. I had fun exploring what is possible when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together! I created a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement. This activity required me to bring together my skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.

## Documentation

Bring together skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.

## Upgrading

From time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.
